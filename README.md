# leetcode22

Hi! This repository contains my successful/accepted submissions to leetcode. I'm not focusing on optimising the speed yet, just trying to get a grasp on the algorithm.

Algorithm is not my strongest suit, so I feel that it's important to sharpen my problem-solving ability somehow. I think doing LeetCode would perhaps help me in thinking more like a programmer. :)
