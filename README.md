# leetcode22

Hi! This repository contains my successful/accepted submissions to leetcode. I'm not focusing on optimising the speed yet, just trying to get a grasp on the algorithm.

I feel that it's important to sharpen my problem-solving ability and doing this would perhaps help me in thinking more like a programmer. :)
